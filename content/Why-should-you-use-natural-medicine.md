## Why Must Natural Medicine ..?

Why are we recommended to take Natural Medicines. The human body itself is created from Nature (Land), so the cure for the various diseases that we suffer from must have been provided for us, namely from Nature, and of course it must be Natural.

In the Qur'an and hadith, there are many mentions of natural ingredients that are recommended for consumption as natural medicine. One of them is honey, dates, ginger, pomegranate, cumin, and olive oil.

The mention of these natural ingredients is certainly not without purpose. If examined, the ingredients mentioned in the Qur'an do have extraordinary properties. Honey is an efficacious sweet liquid produced by bees from the extracts of selected plants. One tablespoon of honey contains 60 calories, 0.1 mg of B vitamins, 1 mg of vitamin C, 11 grams of carbohydrates, 1 mg of calcium, and 0.2 mg of iron. The efficacy of tenetu honey has been known for thousands of years as one of the best natural remedies for various diseases. Even in the Qur'an, Allah mentions honey as medicine.

".. from the belly of the bee comes a drink (honey) of various colors, in it there is medicine that heals for humans .." (Surat An Nahl, 16:69)

The Prophet also said as follows.

"You should use two medicines, namely honey and the Qur'an" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Volume II, p. 1142, hadith No. 3452, chapter "Honey")

In addition to this, here are some considerations why natural medicines are recommended over chemical drugs.

### 1. Medicines derived from nature are believed to have very few side effects.

### 2. Natural medicines are cheaper and easily available around us, such as turmeric, garlic, ginger, temu lawak, lemongrass, noni, shallots.

### 3. Natural medicine is clearly halal. As a believer, we are encouraged to seek treatment with the Hala. It is as contained in the hadith of the Messenger of Allah;
".. Indeed, Allah has not made the cure in everything that is forbidden to you .." (HR Ath Thabrani)
