Here are details of the benefits of eating raw garlic that you can get if you consume it regularly:

## Benefits of Eating Raw Garlic

Consuming garlic in the morning can be a natural remedy to strengthen immunity. The allicin content in garlic is effective for killing disease-causing bacteria, sore throats, such as colds, and coughs. Its diallyl sulfide content can also help fight bacteria in the body.

Garlic also contains sulfates which are formed from the decomposition of allicin which can help get rid of acne scars, and other allergic skin diseases.

### 4. Lowers Cholesterol

Consuming raw garlic before bed can help prevent high cholesterol levels in the blood. This is based on a research journal published in the Journal of Postgraduate Medicine which revealed that consuming about 10 grams or 1 to 2 cloves of garlic every day in a row for a month can significantly lower cholesterol levels.

In addition, other studies also prove this, namely the Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Medicine which found the benefits of eating raw garlic can increase the amount of HDL cholesterol or good cholesterol and reduce total cholesterol levels in the blood.

### 5. Controlling Blood Pressure

Even garlic is considered comparable to generic hypertension drugs. The benefits of eating raw garlic have been stated by the Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical which revealed that the effect of garlic can lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure which is equivalent to the hypertension drug atenolol.

### 6. Offers Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Consuming raw garlic is more effective in reducing the anti-inflammatory effect compared to processed garlic. These benefits are apart from the allicin content in garlic. You can get these benefits if you consume raw garlic in moderation, aka not excessive because if you consume raw garlic it can actually make it worse if consumed in excess.

### 7. Maintain Heart Health

You can maintain heart health by regularly consuming raw garlic. Because garlic is effective in lowering bad cholesterol (LDL) levels so that it can prevent the formation of enzymes in the liver which are usually the cause of cholesterol levels in the body.

It turns out that the diallyl trisulfide content in garlic can also help protect the heart for people who have had a heart attack or after heart surgery and people who have experienced heart failure treatment. The fame of the benefits of garlic is actually not many studies that prove it can maintain heart health.

### 9. Lowering the Risk of Cancer

The benefits of eating raw garlic which is phenomenal is that it can reduce the risk of cancer. Several studies have proven that consuming raw garlic on a regular basis can reduce the risk of several types of cancer, such as stomach cancer and colon cancer. The National Cancer Institute even recommends consuming raw garlic over garlic supplements.

Consuming raw garlic twice a week can reduce the risk of lung cancer by 40 percent. Garlic can also reduce the risk of prostate cancer with its antioxidant content that is able to ward off toxins and strengthen the immune system, so as to repair DNA damaged by prostate cancer.

### 10. Prevents Alzheimer's And Dementia

Raw garlic contains antioxidants that are good for preventing brain tissue problems, such as Alzheimer's and dementia. Alzheimer's disease and dementia can be caused by oxidative stress due to free radicals, so consuming antioxidants is effective in preventing them from getting worse. This is also a sustainable effect because consuming raw garlic is good for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol which can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

### 11. Increases Fertility

The benefits of eating raw garlic to increase fertility have been suggested by the Journal of Herbmed Pharmacology. The research revealed that garlic contains antioxidants that can improve testosterone levels and testicular structure which causes better sperm quality. This research has not been carried out further on the benefits of garlic to make one's fertility effective.

### 12. Overcoming Impotence

The antioxidants present in garlic can overcome impotence. The effect is that the blood becomes diluted and the blood flow to the penis will be smoother so that it can stimulate a penile erection. The benefits of eating raw garlic can be done before sexual activity.

### 13. Improve Sports Performance

Do you like to exercise ..? Well, consuming raw garlic can actually improve sports performance for the better. This has been discussed in research in the Indian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology which shows that consuming garlic oil twice a day for six weeks can improve exercise performance, especially in people with heart disease. The testability of this benefit still requires a lot of further research because it sees this research still experiencing many contradictions.

### 14. Fights Bacteria and Fungi

Referring to research that has been done by Washington State University revealed that the diallyl sulfide content in garlic is able to overcome Campylobacter bacteria which is usually the cause of digestive disorders. That is why raw garlic is able to fight bacteria and fungi in humans, even 100 times more effective than antibiotics in general. That's why garlic has great potential to make it an alternative to natural antibiotics.

### 15. Maintain Brain Health

Besides being useful for maintaining heart health, consuming raw garlic is also beneficial for maintaining brain health. Based on research from the University of Missouri states that the carbohydrate content of space in garlic can protect brain cells from the effects of aging and disease. It can reduce nitric oxide levels in brain microglia cells while fighting inflammation and oxidative stress.

In the brain, microglia cells are useful for maintaining a healthy nervous system, but can fight inflammation if they produce more nitric oxide which can cause brain cell damage. So that is why the FruArg content in garlic can increase microglia cells without increasing nitric oxide levels in the brain. So consuming raw garlic can maintain the health of brain cells.

### 16. Relieve Lead Poisoning

In the world of health, lead poisoning is very risky in various kinds of serious health problems. However, these symptoms can be alleviated by one of them consuming raw garlic regularly. The content of diallyl sulfide and sulfur in garlic is believed to be able to provide effective protection from heavy metal content, such as lead that can enter the human body.

Studies from Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology have shown that the content of garlic can reduce blood lead levels by up to 19%. This study is a study conducted on employees of a car battery factory who have a lot of contact with tin.

Why is the benefit of garlic better eaten raw..? Some people may judge that the taste of raw garlic is very bad, especially coupled with a very pungent aroma.

But believe me, in the most immediate condition, garlic nutrition can work optimally in the body. Although for some people it may be unnatural to consume raw garlic, this can maximize the nutritional value of garlic compared to being processed first or even mixed with other ingredients.

## How Much Raw Garlic Can You Eat..?

Because of its properties that can be said to be very efficacious, it should not make us too crazy or excessive in consuming raw garlic. Actually there is no patent recommendation in determining how much we should consume raw garlic. If you have a healthy body condition and do not have serious health problems, then you can eat 1-4 cloves of garlic per day.
