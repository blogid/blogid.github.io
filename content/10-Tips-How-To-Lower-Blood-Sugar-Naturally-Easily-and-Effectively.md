Is blood sugar rising because you eat a lot of foods high in fat and sugar? High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is a condition in which the body cannot carry sugar in the body from the blood to the cells effectively. Usually, this condition is a sign of diabetes or chronic diabetes that lasts a long time.

The high blood sugar in the body can be caused by insulin disorders. But there is also the consumption of unhealthy food and drink. For example, often consuming artificially sweetened drinks, high-carbohydrate and low-fiber foods, all of which can trigger high blood sugar.

To avoid this hyperglycemia, you must start living a healthy life and pay attention to the intake in food and drink. Here are some natural ways you can do to help reduce blood sugar!

## Tips for Lowering Body's Blood Sugar Naturally

There are several steps you can take to prevent excessive blood sugar rises. Here are 10 tips:

### 1. Avoid Stress

At any time, it is not uncommon to find people who are stressed, whatever the cause. Stress is a trigger for various health problems, one of which is high blood sugar.

Meditation is one way to lower blood sugar by relieving stress. Set aside time to empty your mind of all burdens, learn to breathe properly and your body will feel more refreshed and relieved.

Of course, there are many other ways to relieve stress. But, there's nothing wrong with trying meditation in your spare time, right?

### 2. Keep exercising

Excess weight is one of the triggers of high blood sugar. With diligent exercise, you can lose weight and increase the body's sensitivity to insulin. When you exercise, your muscles use the sugar in your body as an energy source. As a result, blood sugar will naturally fall.

No need for strenuous exercise, you can start from light activities such as leisurely walks, and others. Come on, exercise right now!

### 3. Consumption of High-Fiber

Foods High-fiber foods can slow the absorption of carbohydrates and sugar in the body. This prevents blood sugar from rising quickly. In addition to stabilizing blood sugar, high-fiber foods can also suppress appetite. Suitable for consumption every day.

Some high-fiber foods that you can choose are fruits, vegetables, oatmeal, whole grain foods, and nuts. Be careful, there are many high-fiber products that come with sugar. To lower blood sugar, you must avoid sugar.

### 4. Pay Attention to Carbohydrate Intake

For diabetics, of course you have heard of the negative impact of carbohydrates, yes. Our bodies break down carbohydrates into sugar and glucose, then insulin works to move sugar into cells. Of course there is a limit to the work of insulin.

When you eat too many carbohydrates, insulin fails to move the sugar, causing blood sugar levels to rise.

Start to eat carbohydrates that are low on the glycemic-index (GI) or low glycemic index from now on. Examples include brown rice, vegetables, fruit, nuts, and yogurt. These types of foods can help stabilize blood sugar.

### 5. Consumption of Electrolytes and Magnesium Supplements

When we urinate frequently due to high blood sugar, our bodies will lose fluids and electrolytes. Electrolytes such as magnesium, potassium, sodium, and phosphate are needed to keep the body hydrated and organs to function properly.

To restore electrolytes, you can try drinking low-sugar sports drinks such as Pocari Sweat or low-fat milk. According to studies, magnesium has an important role in reducing blood sugar. Usually people with diabetes are recommended to consume magnesium as much as 250-350 mg.

You can get magnesium through foods such as bananas, sweet potatoes, and nuts. Or it can be obtained from magnesium supplements which are more practical.

### 6. Drink Lots of Water

Did you know, one of the body's natural ways to lower blood sugar is through urination? Excess sugar will be excreted through the urine so that the body's blood sugar levels remain stable. In other words, if the body lacks fluids, sugar will tend to be more difficult to expel and stay in our bodies. This causes high blood sugar.

Therefore, don't forget to always drink eight 230 ml glasses of water per day or a total of 2 liters. With this you will not be dehydrated and sugar levels become stable.

### 7. Sleep Enough

Sleep is the simplest and easiest way to lower blood sugar. Fatty acids in the body will naturally decrease during sleep at night. These fatty acids play an important role in regulating insulin and preventing high blood sugar.

When sleeping, you should pay attention to the quantity and quality of sleep. It is recommended to sleep a minimum of 7 hours. Improve sleep quality by avoiding caffeine a few hours before bedtime, not taking too long a nap, or taking melatonin supplements.

### 8. Pay attention to the amount of intake portion

of food is an important factor for lowering blood sugar. Portion control can help you lose weight and keep blood sugar spikes at bay.

Some easy ways to control your portions like learn to count calories, try to use a smaller plate size, and eat more slowly (chewing food more thoroughly).

### 9. Consumption

Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is proven to contain many health benefits, from skin, digestion, to blood sugar. In one study, people who regularly consumed apple cider vinegar had lower blood sugar levels.

Add apple cider vinegar to your daily diet, either as a salad dressing or as a condiment. You can also make a concoction of apple cider vinegar. Like this; Mix 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and a little cinnamon powder to 1 cup of water. Drink this concoction regularly to feel the benefits.

### 10. Consumption of Vitamin D Supplements

In one study, people who consume vitamin D regularly will have more stable blood sugar levels. Vitamin D is useful for increasing the work of pancreatic cells in producing insulin.

Vitamin D supplements are highly recommended for type 2 diabetes. However, it's best to check with your doctor first as these supplements can affect some medications.

So you guys, those are some tips that NHT Pages can share to lower blood sugar naturally without drugs. Don't forget to check your blood sugar regularly to avoid complications!
