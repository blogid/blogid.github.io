## There are three aspects that must be considered if we want to always live a healthy life and not be approached by disease.

These three aspects are, First, a healthy heart (heart). Second, a healthy body. Third, healthy food. All of that influence each other in giving birth to the health condition of the body. If there is an imbalance of these three aspects, you can be sure the body will get sick or get sick.

### 1. Healthy Heart

Good and bad health of a person's body is very closely dependent on the good and bad heart (heart) of the person. The health of the heart (heart) is very important in the health of the whole body. Because it is in accordance with the following words of the Prophet.

"Know that in this person there is a lump of flesh. If it is good, the whole body is good. If it is bad, the whole body is bad. Know that it is the heart (heart)."
(Narrated by Al Bukhari)

In this daily life, we can find the truth of the hadith. For example, people who suffer from stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, tumors, cancer, and other chronic diseases turn out to have a temper, are often irritated, and passionate about others. These qualities are none other than the source of an unhealthy heart condition.

A scientist from Japan said in his book that human DNA has the characteristics of on (on) and off (off). The on and off of a human gene depends on the way of thinking. When we think positively, the positive genes will turn on as well as turn off the negative genes. And vice versa, when we think negatively, the negative genes will turn on and the positive genes will turn off.

Positive thinking can lead to feelings of happiness, pleasure, and calm. These feelings will affect the performance of the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems so that the body's immunity can recover.

That this heart can also hurt like body pain as Ibn Qayyim Al Jauziyah said. The cure is to repent and regret it. The heart can also be dirty like dirty clothes. And the way to clean it is by dhikr to the God of this universe.

A healthy heart is a heart that knows and is close to its Lord. To get it, you must always have a good attitude towards Allah, towards creatures, and towards every event that is experienced.

Positive thinking can lead to feelings of calm, pleasure, and happiness.

### 2. Healthy Food

Good and halal food is very influential on the health of the body. Food that is not good and not halal can attack, harm, and change the normal function of the body. Because most diseases arise also as a result of eating unhealthy foods.

By nature, our entire body has been created properly to submit and obey Allah. Our bodies are set up to receive and give good. Therefore, when the body accepts (eats) food that is not good and unclean, the body will reject it. The rejection of the body that we are not aware of is then known as illness or disease.

We can see that in the Qur'an itself Allah has emphasized two characteristics of food that must be consumed, namely halal food and thayyib. The food consumed is not only halal, but also good and healthy.

A food can be called good and healthy if it meets general parameters such as safe for consumption, both long and short term, grows in soil that is high in minerals, free from synthetic chemicals, gets sunlight, is not exposed to heavy metals, and does not occur much processing.

By eating healthy and halal food, it means that we have kept the trust that God has given us in the form of a body. Keeping the body healthy so that we can always obey is a sign of our gratitude to Him.

Keeping the body healthy to increase obedience to Allah is a sign of our gratitude to Him.

### 3. Healthy Body

Physical health can be obtained by maintaining environmental and personal health, exercising regularly, and maintaining a good diet.

Maintaining personal health for example by diligently bathing, washing hands, wearing masks, following the sunnah fitrah (circumcision, shaving pubic hair, plucking armpit hairs, cutting nails, and shaving mustaches), and washing fruits and vegetables. As for environmental hygiene, for example, cleaning the house, throwing garbage in its place, not smoking, cleaning the gutters, and others.

Regular exercise has a positive impact on the body. In addition to maintaining health, regular exercise can also increase self-confidence.

As a believer, the orientation in exercising is still worship. The purpose of exercising is to be healthy, to be strong in worshiping Allah.

The sport that is carried out is certainly not a type of sport that is dangerous, does not reveal aurat, and does not contain superstition. Therefore, it is better to do sunnah sports that have been exemplified by the Prophet, including riding, archery, swimming, running, and wrestling.
