## Get to know more about illness and disease.

### What is a disease, what is the definition of the disease itself..?

Disease is a certain abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of a part of the entire body of a living being.

However, this is not the result of any external injury.

Disease can also be known as a medical condition associated with certain clinical signs and symptoms. A disease can be caused by external factors such as pathogens or internal dysfunction. For example, internal dysfunction of the immune system can result in a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immune deficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies, and autoimmune diseases.

### Are sickness and illness the same..?

Many people tend to interpret the two the same. In fact, illness is a term for a bad state of mind, body, and other things such as the soul. Sickness is a general feeling when a person feels sick or unwell (a person's state other than being healthy) due to illness. The disease is basically an imbalance that occurs in the body, be it a physical imbalance or an imbalance of the liver.

The Muslim scholars gave many guidelines about this disease, including Ibn Qayyim Al Jauziyah. He divided disease into physical and nonphysical. Both of these diseases lead to an imbalance in intake or food that enters the body. Non-physical illness is usually caused by emotional imbalance. This disease can be in the form of anger, hatred, malice, and other heart diseases that can cause physical pain. Here, we need to understand that even non-physical diseases can very well cause physical illness and even death, which is known as 'ain disease.

The cure for all that is to return it to the instructions of the Qur'an and the sunnah of the Prophet. The thing that can be done is to read or recite the Qur'an.

In addition to the Qur'an, you can also read or recite the verses of rukiah syar'iyah. Fasting can also be done as a way to cleanse or balance the condition of the body. Fasting is one of the methods of cleansing the body and spirit or heart that has been known for a long time in Islam. In addition, prayer can also be a means of maintaining a healthy body, including by performing the tahajjud prayer. Routinely praying tahajjud will not only get a great reward and virtue, but also can avoid disease. This is based on the words of the Prophet.

"The tahajjud prayer can remove sins, bring peace, and prevent disease." (HR At Tirmidhi)

In addition, things that can be done to treat disease is to increase charity charity. In addition to making our wealth more blessed and useful, giving alms can also be one of the wasilah for the coming of healing from God for the illness.

The Messenger of Allah said, "Fortify your wealth with zakat, heal the sick with alms, and welcome the waves of disaster with prayer and tdharru' (with hope)." (Narrated by Imam Abu Dawud, Imam Ath Tabrani, and Imam AI Baihaqi)

The principles of treatment like this should be the main choice of Muslims in health or treating their disease.

If the imbalance lasts a long time, the cleaning process may also take a long time. That is, as long as a person eats and drinks unhealthy, then he must clean himself, for example by fasting.

By understanding the concept of real disease that the Prophet taught, we will understand that actually physical disease comes from heart or heart disease. Therefore, if a Muslim is sick, it is the heart that must receive much more attention than the body. Ways that can be done include increasing dhikr, doing repentance, reading the Qur'an, giving charity, and doing other good things that feed the heart.

This is what distinguishes the concept of health and illness in Islam. It is not in the world of Western medicine that talks more about the physical or human body. In addition, the question that should be asked of every sick believer is "why". Why is he sick..? Why was he given pain by Allah ..? If he already understands, Allah will make it easier for him to think about treating his illness.

It is very easy for Allah to treat the disease of a human being. By His grace, God will give him healing. In fact, Allah can heal a person's illness only through a glass of water that is read a prayer. It depends on the obedience of a servant to Allah.

The longer given health, a believer will be more grateful and carry out his obedience to Allah. When sick. he will be patient and take his pain as wasilah to gain forgiveness from Allah. Health makes him grateful and pain makes him patient. This is the key word meaning health and illness for a believer.
