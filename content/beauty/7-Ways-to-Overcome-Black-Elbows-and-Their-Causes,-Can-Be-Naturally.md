One of the causes of black elbows is the lack of exfoliation. You can overcome it with natural ingredients on a regular basis.

Although rarely exhibited, dark elbows are still considered disturbing appearance and make a person insecure. As an area that is not directly visible, the elbow is prone to being missed when someone does a series of body treatments.

In fact, the skin on the elbows is thinner and prone to adverse reactions. Apart from the many causes of darkened elbows, there are steps you can take to treat them.

You can overcome this by utilizing natural ingredients that are at home. Read more in the following!

## Causes of Dark Elbows

Before dealing with them, we need to know the root of the problem. Here are some reasons why elbows can darken:

1. Lack of exfoliation, this causes the accumulation of dead skin cells and makes the skin look dull.
2. Prolonged sun exposure causes hyperpigmentation and darker skin tone.
3. Hormonal changes or body reactions.
4. Pigmentation due to skin aging.
5. UV radiation.
6. Friction due to skin contact with certain fabrics, or any external object.
7. Skin problems such as psoriasis or eczema.
8. Skin damage after injury to knees and elbows.

Keep in mind, elbow skin tissue is thin and more prone to react when experiencing the problems above.

## How to Overcome Black Elbows with Natural Ingredients.

Here's a complete way to overcome black elbows with natural ingredients. Do it regularly to get rid of black elbows!

### 1. Aloe Vera for Moisturizing

Dark skin patches can also invite dryness and peeling, so to overcome this you have to deal with this dryness. If you have an aloe vera plant, you can get it directly.

First, open the fleshy aloe vera leaf and remove the pulp. Then, crush it a little with your hands and apply it on your dry elbows and knees. Leave it on for 20 minutes and feel the calmness of moisturized and nourished skin. After that, rinse with cold water.

Using aloe vera gel which is available in stores is also not a problem. Because they are generally formulated to be able to absorb into the skin, you don't need to rinse them.

### 2. Mixture of Olive Oil and Sugar

One of the causes of dull and dark skin is the lack of exfoliation, aka the removal of dead skin cells from the skin layer. One way to exfoliate is to use a scrub.

Sugar is a natural ingredient whose texture is ideal for scrubbing and giving a radiant look to the skin, while olive oil is a nutrient-rich skin moisturizer.

### 3. Citrus Fruit Extract Citrus

fruits aka various oranges can provide protection from sun exposure and help brighten the skin. Research concludes that red orange extract can help prevent skin damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays and keep skin pigmentation even.

You can potentially reduce the appearance of black elbows by consuming citrus fruits or using products that contain their extracts.

### 4. Colloidal Oatmeal

The easiest way to make colloidal oatmeal is to grind the oatmeal into a powder with a blender. The next step is to mix it with water until it becomes like mush so that it is easier to absorb into the skin.

Some of the potentials of colloidal oatmeal are:

1. Protects the skin from the sun
2. Moisturizes the skin
3. Treats conditions that affect the skin, such as psoriasis
4. Basically, the benefits above reduce the risk of dark skin.
5. Coconut Oil and Warm Baths

Another ingredient that can treat dry skin is coconut oil. Massage elbows with coconut oil until completely absorbed. To find out if it's absorbed enough or not, make sure you massage it until your skin no longer feels greasy.

After that, nice warm shower. So that the skin is not dry, avoid using soap at this stage.

### 6. Turmeric

Who would have thought, this one kitchen spice has benefits when used as an external treatment on the skin. Two different studies examining the effects of turmeric on the skin show that turmeric is effective in reducing fine lines and wrinkles, and can help remove dark spots on the skin.

Likewise, when used on dark elbows and knees, skin tones appear to glow. Make sure to rinse it off after 10 minutes with cold water.

### 7. Sunscreen

One of the main causes of dark skin is sunlight. Therefore, sun protection must be taken into account in overcoming dark areas of the body. Apply sunscreen before you go out. Make sure you put it on after moisturizing your elbows, okay?

Dark elbows are sometimes difficult to treat. However, a little patience and simple patience can help over time.
